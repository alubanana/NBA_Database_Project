1,Chris Paul to Knicks: How it could happen,"Chris Paul-to-the-Knicks rumors date back to as far as 10 years ago when Paul made a toast at Carmelo Anthony¡¯s wedding talking about a Big Three in New York with Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Once Anthony got moved to the Knicks, Paul reportedly requested a trade there as well in December 2011 after the lockout ended. He later expanded his choice of cities to Los Angeles, and would eventually be traded to the Los Angeles Clippers.

Ten years later, the Knicks could be preparing to make another run at Paul. The almost 35-year old is having another strong year where the Oklahoma City Thunder have greatly exceeded expectations under Paul¡¯s leadership and sit in sixth place in the West with a 39-24 record, only a game and a half behind fourth place. Aside from winning in what was expected to be a rebuilding season, he has been a tremendous backcourt partner with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who picked up a lot from Paul both on and off the court.

Statistically, his points, rebounds, assists, and steals have gradually dropped since 2015-16 while his minutes aren¡¯t significantly lower. While those numbers don¡¯t jump out at you, it¡¯s his impact metrics that speak volumes to his level of play. He currently ranks No. 8 in player impact plus-minus (PIPM). He also ranks ninth in both Win Shares and Offensive Win Shares.

Perhaps the biggest thing for his team is his availability. Paul has played in 62 of 63 games so far in 2019-20, which would be on track to be his healthiest season since 2015-16, when he only missed eight games.

Can the Knicks expect the same level of developmental leadership, production, and availability if they acquire Paul? It¡¯s quite a lot to hope for, but what Paul can mean for the development of their young players alone may be worth the remaining $85.6 million remaining on his contract. RJ Barrett, Kevin Knox, Dennis Smith Jr., and Frank Ntilikina can all improve their offensive facilitation and defense with Paul. The Knicks can¡¯t expect their young players to replicate the strides Gilgeous-Alexander made under Paul, but just learning how to play organized basketball under one of the best floor generals of all-time could have enough value to justify a trade for him.

Acquiring Paul shouldn¡¯t be complicated for the Knicks. They have enough salary-filler to get CP3 and adequate young players and future draft picks to interest the Thunder. The Knicks only need to send out $32.987,051 in salary to acquire Paul¡¯s $41,358,814 cap hit for 2020-21. They can guarantee a combination of Taj Gibson ($9.45 million), Wayne Ellington ($8 million), Elfrid Payton ($8 million), and Reggie Bullock ($4.2 million), and package them with one or two of their young players to reach the minimum outgoing salary amount.",7-Mar-20,
2,James Harden¡¯s legacy shouldn¡¯t be this complicated,"Harden¡¯s prime collided with the unforeseeable rise of a formidable Golden State Warriors dynasty, LeBron James¡¯ remarkable third act, and another super team built overnight in Los Angeles that features two players (Kawhi Leonard and Paul George) who can make his life extraordinarily difficult. Of course, Harden is not without blame, either. There are unforgettable, inexplicably poor postseason performances on his resume that could only be explained by a conspiracy theory.

Flashbulb memories of Harden getting benched during the fourth quarter of Game 6 in the 2015 conference semifinals as his Rockets stormed back to take down the Los Angeles Clippers. (Harden also played 44 minutes in Houston¡¯s Game 7 win, finishing with 31 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, and three steals.) Next up was the eventual champs. Harden was a monster in the first two games of that series, with 58.5/44.4/87.5 shooting splits to go with a 33-point triple-double. He was plus-9 while Houston lost both by a combined five points.",3-Mar-20,
3,"Warriors' Stephen Curry diagnosed with seasonal flu, misses game","""I was with Steph [on Friday] in practice and also in Oakland yesterday afternoon, and he was fine,"" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said before the game. ""So he woke up this morning feeling sick. I know his young son was sick for a couple of days, so he probably got it from his son, but our doctors checked him out, and it is the basic flu.""

Curry's latest setback stunts the momentum the Warriors were hoping to build after he returned to the lineup. Kerr noted that growing fear surrounding the coronavirus was something he and his team have talked about together in recent days.",7-Mar-20,
4,"LeBron James, Anthony Davis confident in their 3-point shooting","Anthony Davis is a complete basketball player. He can protect the rim and rebound the ball on one end, and beat his defenders with his ball-handling and post moves on the other end. But the one part of Davis¡¯ game that¡¯s still a work in progress is his 3-point jump shot, and the Los Angeles Lakers have pushed him to improve in that area this season with some success.

Before the start of a four-game road trip in November, Lakers head coach Frank Vogel challenged Davis to attempt five 3-pointers per game. Over the next four games, Davis attempted 5.8 3-pointers per game and converted them at a 39.1% clip. While that experiment didn¡¯t result in Davis attempting five 3-pointers per game for the rest of the season, it seems to have helped him get more comfortable taking that shot, as he¡¯s attempting a career-high 3.4 triples per game this season and making them at a 33.7% rate, which is also a career-high.

After Tuesday¡¯s game against the Philadelphia 76ers, where Davis made four 3-pointers (tied for his career-high) in five attempts, he talked about his improvement as a shooter, and the boost in confidence that¡¯s come with it (via Spectrum SportsNet):",6-Mar-20,
5,"Kenny Atkinson's tenure with Nets comes to surprising end, as sources say Kyrie Irving prefers Tyronn Lue to take over","NEW YORK ¡ª The clock on Kenny Atkinson¡¯s time with the Brooklyn Nets started ticking the moment Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving arrived on his doorstep, when the franchise turned from afterthought to relevant.

The atmosphere Atkinson helped build ¡ª one that was apparently so attractive to Durant and Irving ¡ª seems like it played a part in his undoing. Whether he was fired or ¡°mutually parting ways¡±, as the Nets news release states, is immaterial.

In a year that was nothing more than groundwork for the future, the meshing of Atkinson¡¯s style with Durant and Irving was on trial. Even though Irving only played 20 games and is out for the season following shoulder surgery and Durant is still recovering from his Achilles injury, everyone had to deal with each other and honestly evaluate if this would be a marriage that would stand into next season.",7-Mar-20,
6,Report: Jimmy Butler Says Bam Adebayo ¡®Best Teammate¡¯ He¡¯s Ever Had,"Adebayo, 22, is having a phenomenal 2019-20 campaign.

The third-year pro is averaging career-highs across the board this season. He is putting up 16.1 points, 10.5 boards and 5.0 assists per game.

In addition, Abdebayo has been a productive, fun and encouraging teammate. Multiple players have pointed to his leadership and example as major parts of the team¡¯s success this season.

For Butler to call the University of Kentucky product the best teammate he¡¯s ever had says a ton about Adeabyo.

Butler, 30, has played with several talented players, including Dwyane Wade, Joel Embiid, Derrick Rose, J.J. Redick and Tobias Harris.

The partnership between Butler and Adebayo has been extremely fruitful this season. The Heat are on their way to having one the best seasons in franchise history.",8-Mar-20,
7,NBARockets star Russell Westbrook gets trolled for outfit in game vs. Hornets,"
Houston Rockets star point guard Russell Westbrook has always been known for his unique style choices. From wacky patterns, crazy materials or anything in between, Westbrook is not afraid to go against the grain when it comes to fashion.

During Saturday¡¯s game between the Rockets and the Charlotte Hornets, the former MVP sat on the bench. Westbrook had been ruled out for the game in a case of load management and, as a result, was wearing a suit on the sideline as most players who are not playing do.",7-Mar-20,
8,Interim Nets coach Jacque Vaughn replaces Jarrett Allen with DeAndre Jordan in starting lineup,"Vaughn will move Jarrett Allen, a first-round pick in the 2017 draft, to the bench for Jordan, an 11-year veteran in his first season in Brooklyn.

Jordan and Allen were sharing time throughout the season. Jordan averages 8.3 points and 9.9 rebounds in 21.8 minutes per game. He¡¯s started only four games. Allen averages 10.8 points and 9.5 rebounds in 25.9 minutes per game.

Vaughn will serve as interim head coach for the remainder of the season after the Nets announced Saturday morning they were ¡°mutually parting ways¡± with Kenny Atkinson. The team is in seventh place in the Eastern Conference with a 28-34 record while dealing with injuries.

Players were reportedly unhappy with Atkinson, including Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant:",3-Mar-20,
9,LeBron James: 'I ain't playing' if there are no fans due to coronavirus concerns,"
LeBron James said he ¡°ain¡¯t playing¡± if there are no fans in the arena due to concerns about the coronavirus.

The Los Angeles Laker spoke with reporters after the team's win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday at the Staples Center.

""We play games without the fans?"" James asked incredulously. ""Nah, it¡¯s impossible.""


""I ain¡¯t playing,"" James continued. ""I ain¡¯t got the fans in the crowd. That¡¯s who I play for. I play for my teammates. I play for the fans. That¡¯s what it¡¯s all about. If I show up to an arena and there are no fans in there, I ain¡¯t playing. They can do what they want to do.""",7-Mar-20,
10,Damian Lillard believes Trail Blazers could have won a championship if LaMarcus Aldridge never left,"When LaMarcus Aldridge left for the San Antonio Spurs, a piece of Portland was gone. His 9-year stint in Rip City brought upon the departures of the team's core: Nicolas Batum, Wesley Matthews, and Robin Lopez. Damian Lillard was left to rebuild his team from the bottom up.

In this week's episode of Knuckleheads with Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles, the Trail Blazers All-Star discussed what his experience was like playing alongside Aldridge for the first time. ",8-Mar-20,
